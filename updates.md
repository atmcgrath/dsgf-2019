## Updates April 17, 2020

## Katie

I have been exploring ArcGIS Online, trying to re-work my workshop so that it works for the ArcGIS online set up. It has been slightly confusing, as it seems that the online program does not let you upload JPEGs, which was a huge first step of my original workshop, so now I am trying to design a slightly different workshop module. And so I am also reworking my powerpoint to match the ArcGIS map I am making. 


## Devin

I have been working on the rather laborious task of creating a corpus for the AntConc workshop. I had initially only planned to use American legal documents, but decided that it would be more interesting to pull in constitutional documents from other countries and time periods. I feel like this would be especially helpful for envisioning how applications like the keyword list works. I was also hoping that it would give students opportunities to work with the material from a variety of angles; for example, by country or by time period. However, AntConc only accepts .txt files, which means that I have to find all the texts I want and then copy and paste them into a .txt file. I also want a large, representative corpus, which means that it's rather boring, tedious work. Thinking about corpus construction is important, though, and I think that it will help me write parts of the workshop, as being able to construct a representative corpus is a valuable skill.

## RJ

I've been working on building a cltk module/updating my old work for the community of learning (which can be found [here](https://github.com/rjbarnesca/Col.cltk/blob/master/syllabus.md)). The tutorials which cltk offers are useful for getting a grip on how to get the tools to work but they don't really provide a clear sense of what type of work the tools can do and how they can be applied to a real project. So, as I've be updating and expanding the cltk tutorials for my module, rather than randomly selecting examples of Latin and Greek and showing how they can be broken down into number, I've been looking for specific examples which showcase the usefulness of certain tools and suggesting possible applications. It's more time consuming, but I think it'll be more rewarding in the end.



## Andrea's Workshop Proposals

**Workshop 1: Photoshop for images in papers and publications (basic Photoshop)**

Are you about to turn in your final paper or submit an article and your images need some TLC?  *In this workshop students will learn how to prepare images for inclusion in seminar papers or for publication.*  The focus will be on basic skills such as cropping, color alteration, adding text, removal of text or other unwanted information, layers, file types, etc.  The workshop will take about an hour and require a computer lab with a projection screen and computers equipped with Photoshop.  Sample images will be provided, but students are encouraged to bring their own images to edit.  By the end of this workshop students will be able to prepare and improve old images, images scanned from publications, maps, and photographs for their final papers or papers bound for publication.

**Workshop 2: Mapping in practice and final product (ArcGIS and Illustrator)**

Have you created or want to create a map, but don't know how to translate it into a usable image for your paper or article?  *In this workshop students will learn how to create their own maps in ArcGIS and make publication quality scale maps in Illustrator.*  The focus will be on basic skills in ArcGIS such as marking sites and drawing lines and polygons and importing this information into Illustrator to create a map with an accurate scale for papers and publications.  The workshop will take about an hour and require a computer lab with a projection screen and computers equipped with ArcGIS and Illustrator.  By the end of this workshop students will be able to make basic maps to scale for papers and publications.

### Andrea's Updates

- Spent some time looking for information on different databases for my dissertation, such as FileMaker, Microsoft Access, MobiDB, and PostgresSQL.  I'm currently planning to use Filemaker since I'm familiar with it and other BMC archaeology PhD students have used it to make similar catalogs of objects in the past and still recommend it.

## Devin's Workshop Proposals
*In this workshop, students will learn basic Python skills in order to use the Classical Languages Toolkit (CLTK) and the Natural Language Processing Toolkit (NLTK).* The focus will be to get enough basic knowledge of Python, and then to apply those skills by doing some work with both CLTK and NLTK; for example, importing corpora, text segmentation, tokenizing words, normalizing, getting frequencies, creating visualizing measures, and stopword filtering. This workshop will take several hours and, ideally, the work would be split between at least two people. By the end of this workshop, students will enough knowledge of Python to use CLTK and NLTK, and have worked through the material in the first three CLTK Github tutorials.

### Devin's Updates

- I spent most of my time trying to get CLTK to work on Windows. I think that I may have found a workaround using Anaconda Prompt, but I am still trying to work out all the details. I am meeting with Alice after our meeting to hopefully figure everything out, which should let me get a start on the tutorials over break.

## RJ's workshop ideas

**HTML/CSS**
- an introductory course on HTML/CSS (and maybe Markdown). We can build a personal site, online cv, annotated bibliography, vel sim..

**classical languages tool kit course (w/Devin)**
- a peek at the cltk - its history, requirements, various tools, and possible applications.


### RJ's Updates
- I worked on [classical languages tool kit](http://cltk.org), looked into [zotfile](http://zotfile.com) (for zotero) and Rstudio, and practiced markdown and html/css. I also came across [Palladio](https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/) - an open source program developed by Stanford for mapping social networks across space and time.

## Katie' Workshop Proposal

- In this workshop, students will be introduced to Quantum GIS (QGIS), a free and open source Geographic Information System platform. A QGIS workshop aims to teach students how to view, to edit, and to analysis geospatial data. The workshop is accessible to students with any type of laptop computer, offering an alternative for those unable to downlaod the popoular ArcGIS software. In the workshop, students will walk through a tutorial of the program with the instructor and produce a final map product. By the end of the workshop students will have gained rudimentary skills and knowledge to begin using QGIS for basic purposes.

### Katie's Updates

- I have been working on my personal website, which is based off the work I did this semester for my Digital Archaeology course. The site I used needed to be worked in an HTML editor in order to be successful, so I am beginning to feel more comfortable writing in HTML code, but I have not spent much time working with Markdown yet unfortunately. Also, in terms of workshops, I am uncertainw whether I would want to offer two parts to a GQIS workshop, or design my second one to open for other open-access sites.

## Meeting notes
Note-taker: Devin

### Showcase
- Good job on the showcase! Well attended and lots of good feedback! Go team!
- The presentation slides will go up on the resources page

### Thoughts on the showcase?
- Structure was presented well
- Promote to undergrads as well
- Good turnout
- Maybe questions after every presentation and general questions at the end
- Length was good
- Open it to all graduate and undergraduate students and faculty who are working on digital scholarship projects - model may have to change, like an informal digital research fair. Maybe do both  and aim them at different audiences.
- Approximately 22 people

### Attendance
- Have an attendance sheet for workshops where people sign in and can maybe share their emails
- Keep track of attendance for all events
- LibCal registration will keep track of attendants
- Attendees section added to Event List Excel sheet

### Digital Narratives 
- LibCal is looking for extra helpers on March 11th-12th
- Primarily audio and visual editing

### BlendLAC
- Blended learning conference
- Lightning talk, 20 minute presentation, panel workshop
- Blended learning is conceived broadly and digital scholarship counts
- Less about research projects and more about research projects that involve students or has a pedagogical element
- Proposals due on February 23rd, although application deadline could probably be extended

### Updates on workshops, CoLs, and roles
- Devin: Running Python CoL. Four people have shown up. Also doing CLTK CoL. 
- Andrea: FileMaker CoL starts Monday - figure out what everyone wants to do, download software. Scheduled a new Photoshop workshop. Research assitant for HART professor - turning pictures of backs of mirrors that are embossed into vector images. First Photoshop workshop went well. Some technical difficulties at first but it worked. 50/50 grad/undergrad. Same images for everyone. Went well! Yay!
- RJ: Doing CLTK CoL and figuring out how all the tools work. Also doing Python CoL. Messing around with OpenRefine.
- Molly: Went to Digital Mapping Projection Workshop. Free online resource: MapMap. Lots of planning.
- Katie: Planning GIS workshop. Two hour timeblock - short presentation, walk through all the basics - what can it do, all the components. Followed a tutorial and made her own map but would take too long in workshop. Will give them images and walk them through those. Download old maps of Bryn Mawr and then georefernece them onto a base map of Bryn Mawr.

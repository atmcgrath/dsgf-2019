# Planning for remote learning

## March 3, 2020

### Digital pedagogy reflections
- What works well in your experience?
  - Analog element of learning face to face can't be replicated
  - What can you do with asynchronous learning? Could be more effective than trying to replicate in-person learning
  - Having everyone use the same data or work with the same materials
  - In-person: participants can help eachother trouble-shoot
- Having a helper with a workshop (Katie)

### Brainstorming

#### Workshop options
- Reschedule for Fall (maybe)
- Handouts/cheatsheets/powerpoints: posting to the website
- Learning modules (for DSSF program)
- Tutorials and instructions with screenshots

- AntConc - creating easy tutorial with a screenshot
- Python - remote office hours & sharing tutorial/project
- CLTK - put up weekly activities; set up office hours
- FileMaker - remote web-conferencing
- Mapping/Google earth - video/powerpoint with voiceover
- GIS (Katie) - creating a module or possibly video, activity 
- Molly - Palladio - creating a module  

#### Communities of Learning - Ideas
- Tutorials and instructions with screenshots
- Remote office hours or shared work time
- Asynchronous work time (weekly tasks)
- Web-conferencing version

#### Ideas
- Send the community a survey - what would be useful right now? - crowdsourcing
- Suggestion box on the DS website

#### Pedagogical/instructional materials
- LinkedIn Learning curated list of classes
